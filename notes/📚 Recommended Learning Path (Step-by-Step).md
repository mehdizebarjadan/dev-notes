# 🔥 Step 1: Master Django First (Backend)

Start **Django - The Practical Guide**:

 ✅ Learn how to:
    
    - Structure projects
        
    - Create views, templates, and forms
        
    - Use the ORM (Models + QuerySets)
        
    - Build APIs (with Django REST Framework, if included)
        
    - Handle auth and deploy your app

 🛠️ While learning, build a **simple blog** or **task manager** alongside the course.

📌 **Why first?** Django gives you the data/API layer that React will later connect to.

# 🔥 Step 2: Learn React (Frontend)

Start **React - The Complete Course**:

✅ Learn:
    
    - JSX, components, hooks
        
    - State & props
        
    - Fetching data (e.g., from your Django API)
        
    - React Router
        
    - (Optional) Redux
        

🧠 **Goal**: Learn how to create the frontend UI and consume APIs (like your Django backend).
# 🔥 Step 3: Connect Django + React

Now build a **full-stack project**:

- Django as the API backend
    
- React as the frontend
    
- Communicate via `fetch()` or `axios`
    
- Use Django CORS headers
    
- Structure as two separate apps or merge with Vite/React + Django backend
