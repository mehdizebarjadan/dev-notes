Virtual environment
To make sure your VS Code `settings.json` points to the **correct Python virtual environment**, you'll need to:

---

## âœ… Step 1: Identify the Python interpreter path

In your terminal (inside the Django project directory), run:

bash

CopyEdit

`which python`

If you're inside a virtual environment, this will return something like:

swift

CopyEdit

`/Users/yourname/Projects/django/venv/bin/python`

This is the full path to your virtual environmentâ€™s Python interpreter.

> ðŸ§  Tip: If it just says `/usr/bin/python` or something global, youâ€™re **not in a virtual environment** yet.

---

## âœ… Step 2: Activate Your Virtual Environment (if needed)

If you havenâ€™t created one yet:

bash

CopyEdit

`python3 -m venv venv`

Then activate it:

bash

CopyEdit

`source venv/bin/activate`

Now try:

bash

CopyEdit

`which python`

You should get a path inside your project folder, like:

swift

CopyEdit

`/Users/yourname/Projects/django/venv/bin/python`

---

## âœ… Step 3: Add the Path to VS Code Settings

Open `.vscode/settings.json` and add:

json

CopyEdit

`"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/Users/yourname/Projects/django/venv/bin/python"`

Or use the VS Code variable if `venv` is in the root of your workspace:

json

CopyEdit

`"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/venv/bin/python"`

This tells VS Code to always use your projectâ€™s virtual environment.
